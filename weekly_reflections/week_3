# Week 3 Reflection

I made a lot of progress this past week on my projects. I compiled two budgets for a purchases re-binding materials; one using only Office Depot products, the other using some products found on Amazon that are cheaper and do not require hole punching the paper. I do not feel great about using Amazon products, but I feel a greater pressure to save money that is not mine and get the best possible materials for preservation.

I made some headway on the translation project, as well. I drafted a Google form for translators to input information from their translations, which feeds into a spreadsheet that I will also be using to track my correnspence and ensure translations are coming in. I will begin reachingo out this week.

Lastly, I met with my other DFW students this week to coordinate our overlapping responsibilities. It was helpful for me to gain a better understanding of how my contributions fit into the larger project, as well as to get a better understanding of what my classmates are working on and how I can best support them through my work. Hindsight is 2020, but I think it may have been helpful to have the meeting a week earlier, though I honestly may not have understood what I was doing then.
