# Week 1 Reflection

My main focus this week was getting onboarded. Mostly doing a lot of trainings. It has been interesting to learn more about the scope of IHME's work. I am really excited to get started on my project. I'm looking forward to learning more about preserving these materials, as well as more about their contents.
