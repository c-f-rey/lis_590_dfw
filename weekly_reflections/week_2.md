# Week 2 Reflection

I began my projects in earnest this week, the majority of which was inventorying books that need re-binding and/or translation. This documentation can be found here [link]. 

I then researched materials to put in a purchase order for rebinding. Since OfficeDepot is the vendor for IHME, I have to prioritize products from that seller, which is not know for its archival supplies. I think this is indicative of a lot of library work: having to make compromises due to budgetary and/or organizational constraints.

I also was provided with an overview of my translation project, which will require a lot of coordination with many different people. I will admit I am nervous to begin this work, as it is a lot to keep track of and I am working within an unfamiliar organization. I want to make sure I am respectful of people's time and am prompt and courteous in my correspondence.
