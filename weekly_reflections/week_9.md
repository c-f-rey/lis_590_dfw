### Final Weekly Reflection

It's my last week working at IHME (for now)! I'm going to miss the pretty views, the free coffee, and good company. A COVID exposure through a slight wrench in my plans to wrap up my projects. I was not able to go work in the office as much as I would have liked this week. Thankfully I was able to wrap my projects with a few loose ends.

Translations have been completed to the best of my ability. There are some remaining outliers that the data library services team should hopefully be able to complete relatively soon.

All books have been rebound with the exception of some late additions. I did not process them as comepletely as I was hoping, but in hindsight this would have taken much more time than I had.
