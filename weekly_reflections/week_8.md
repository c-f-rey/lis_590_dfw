### Week 8 Reflection

This week I am continuing to rebind materials. It is taking me a lot longer than expected, which made me feel overwhelmed at first. In the past couple of weeks I expanded the scope of my project to include processing the books in the IHME Lending Library inventory, which added siginificantly more steps and time to my work. After I checked in with Lyla, we agreed to scale back on the scope of the project to focus on translating citations and re-binding books.

Translations have come in for the most part, but not as completely as I had hoped. I've recieved partial translations from folks in the past few days. I don't feel comfortable asking for more help from the translators, because they're very busy and I don't want to take any more of their time. I have one more lead I can follow to get the rest of the citation information translated. I hope that it's fruitful.
