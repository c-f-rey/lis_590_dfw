### Week 7 Reflection

This week I began re-binding data books. I love to work with my hands like this so it's been a joy. I'm so relieved that the binds are working for the most part. I was so worried that they would not end up fitting for whatever reason.

Still working to collect translations. I'm just sending gentle reminders and waiting on responses. I hope responses come in soon!
