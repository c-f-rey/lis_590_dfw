# Week 6 Reflection

This week I began cataloging items in the IHME Lending Library Inventory. It has been interesting to learn more about this part of the process of maintaining the lending library. The work can be tedious, and I do wonder about automating it somehow to save time, but that is beyond my current skillset.

I am still chasing leads on finding translators for Arabic, Farsi, and Polish language resources. So far no one is available until months from now, which may be what the team needs to do. There are still a couple contacts I want to reach out to.

Materials for rebinding have come in today! I am so excited to get started. At my last library job, phycially processing material was my favorite part of the job. I wish I could get a masters degree in that. I am excited to get started on that. I am wondering how I can best keep track of books that I have to creat QR codes for, as well as which books I have re-bound. I think I will add some columns to my spreadsheet.
