# Week 4 Reflection

This week I sent in my purchase request as well as requests for translations. I am relieved as I have made significant headway on my projects. At the same time, further progress is now in other people's hands and all I can do is wait and maybe send gentle reminders. 

I have run into a slight hiccup with the translation project. I am utilizing a directory of IHME who speak languages other than English. However, there’s nobody listed within IHME that speaks Farsi or Polish, and there’s only one person listed who speaks Arabic but 28 Arabic language titles that need translating. I will be meeting with the data library services team this week to brainstorm solutions.
